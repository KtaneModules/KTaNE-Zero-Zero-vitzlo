# Zero, Zero

My first modded module for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, Zero, Zero. Zero, Zero is a puzzle
where a common origin shared by three separate coordinate systems as well as the (+, +) quadrants
for each of the systems must be identified.

Sound effects taken from Bounce Back by Big Sean.

Special thanks to Danny7007 and lone01 for providing much-needed assistance throughout the process
of this module's creation.
